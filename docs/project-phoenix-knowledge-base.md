# Linux Administration Lab — SSH Security and Remote Administration

## Lab Summary

A dedicated Ubuntu Server virtual machine named `phoenix-linux-01` was deployed in the Proxmox HomeLab environment.

The system was configured for secure SSH administration using an existing HomeLab Ed25519 key. Password-based SSH authentication and direct root SSH access were disabled after successful public-key authentication tests.

## Environment

| Component | Configuration |
|---|---|
| Hypervisor | Proxmox VE |
| Virtual machine | `phoenix-linux-01` |
| Operating system | Ubuntu Server 24.04.1 LTS |
| Management IP | `192.168.20.101` |
| Network | Servers network |
| Administrative user | `igor` |
| SSH port | `22` |
| SSH key type | Ed25519 |

## Engineering Workflow

The lab followed a controlled infrastructure change process:

1. Verify the system identity and network address.
2. Create an Omada Controller backup.
3. Configure a fixed DHCP reservation.
4. Verify the SSH service and listening sockets.
5. Deploy the existing HomeLab public key.
6. Confirm key-based authentication.
7. Inspect server-side SSH file permissions.
8. Configure a local SSH alias.
9. Keep two active recovery sessions open.
10. Create a dedicated SSH hardening drop-in.
11. Validate configuration syntax.
12. Reload SSH without terminating active sessions.
13. Verify the effective configuration.
14. Test a new key-based connection.
15. Confirm that password-only authentication is rejected.
16. Document the configuration and recovery procedure.

## Final SSH Configuration

```ssh
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/10-phoenix-hardening.conf

PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

Effective configuration:

```text
permitrootlogin no
pubkeyauthentication yes
passwordauthentication no
```

## Validation Results

### Successful key-based connection

```bash
ssh phoenix-linux-01
```

Result:

- connection successful;
- correct user confirmed;
- correct hostname confirmed;
- no remote account password required.

### Rejected password-only connection

```bash
ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no \
  -o PreferredAuthentications=password \
  igor@192.168.20.101
```

Result:

```text
Permission denied (publickey).
```

## Troubleshooting Scenario

The first hardening file was named:

```text
99-phoenix-hardening.conf
```

Password authentication unexpectedly remained enabled.

Investigation showed that cloud-init had created:

```text
/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/50-cloud-init.conf
```

with:

```ssh
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

The custom hardening file was renamed to:

```text
10-phoenix-hardening.conf
```

After syntax validation and an SSH reload, the intended effective configuration became active.

## Lessons Learned

- Effective configuration must be verified rather than assumed.
- Configuration file order can affect the final SSH settings.
- Cloud-init-managed files should not be modified without understanding their ownership and lifecycle.
- A dedicated configuration drop-in is easier to audit and recover than direct modification of the main SSH configuration.
- Existing sessions and console access should remain available during authentication changes.
- Positive tests confirm that intended access works.
- Negative tests confirm that prohibited access no longer works.
- GUI failure should not block administration when a reliable terminal workflow is available.
- Network configuration changes should be preceded by a current controller backup.

## Portfolio Evidence

This lab demonstrates practical experience with:

- Ubuntu Server administration;
- OpenSSH server management;
- Ed25519 public-key authentication;
- SSH client aliases;
- systemd service management;
- socket and port verification;
- Linux ownership and permissions;
- configuration drop-in files;
- configuration precedence troubleshooting;
- secure change implementation;
- rollback and recovery planning;
- infrastructure documentation.
